//
// class -- NODOCS -- uvm_reg_randval
//
// General register random value generator.
// This class may be instantiated within a register access sequence
// and may be randomized in order to generate a random register value
// based on the context of the sequence's random seed without altering
// the state of other random members of the sequence
