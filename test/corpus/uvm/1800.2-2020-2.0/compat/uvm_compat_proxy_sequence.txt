// CLASS: uvm_compat_proxy_sequence
//
// The uvm_compat_proxy_sequence is provided as a conveience for users
// which need an arbitrary instance of uvm_sequence_base for interacting
// with sequencers/sequence items without having a running sequence.
//
// Prior to 1800.2, it was possible to instance uvm_sequence_base manually
// and then start_item/finish_item on that instance to interact with a
// sequencer.  In 1800.2 the uvm_sequence_base and uvm_sequence#() classes
// were defined as abstract, meaning they can't be arbitrarily instanced.
//
